# 📈 Netflix Stock Price Forecasting using Time Series Models

This project focuses on forecasting **Netflix’s daily closing stock prices** using multiple time series models — **ARIMA**, **LightGBM**, and **LSTM** — built with the `darts` library in Python.

The objective is to analyze past stock price trends, develop predictive models, and evaluate their accuracy using metrics such as **MAPE** and **RMSE**. Through this comparison, the project demonstrates how traditional statistical models, machine learning, and deep learning each perform in financial time series forecasting.
